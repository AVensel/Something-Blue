    Born and raised in Columbus, Ohio, Avery has worked and
     excelled in the hospitality and events industry for over a decade. As a
     graduate of the Culinary Institute of Fort Lauderdale, she began her career
     in events at the Milo Island Resort as well as Marketing Director for
      Holy City Hospitality.
       Avery was recruited by Willowbrook Hospitality
      Group as the Director of Hospitality + Events to launch its inaugural
      venue Upstairs at Midtown, on to opening the awarded Gadsden House,
      Maybank Catering and Willowbrook Beverage Company.
    Avery decided it was time to get back to her design roots and knew event
     planning & design is where she always wanted to end up.  From the planning
      stages to execution, Avery will provide each and every client with
      individualized service to ensure success. Her personalized planning
      experience creates events that guest will be swooning over for years to come.
